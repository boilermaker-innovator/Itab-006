I see the issue - the generated widget code doesn't have functional popups. Let me fix the widget generation function to include proper popup functionality:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I've completely updated the JavaScript to generate a fully functional reaction widget with working popups. The new generated code now includes:

1. **Complete Popup System**
   - Reaction popup with 4 preset options
   - Info popup showing statistics
   - Proper toggle functionality

2. **Reaction Storage**
   - Stores reactions in localStorage
   - Tracks if user has already reacted
   - Calculates percentage statistics

3. **Proper Position Handling**
   - Positions both the main widget and popups based on selected position
   - Maintains consistent spacing between widget and popups

4. **Clean Styling**
   - Separate CSS section for better organization
   - Properly styled buttons and popups
   - Consistent design language

To test this in CodePen:

1. Make sure you've copied all three sections (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to their respective panels
2. Click the "Generate Widget Code" button
3. The output area will show the complete widget code with functional popups
4. You can copy this code to use in any website

This minimal implementation focuses on ensuring the tabs work properly while still generating useful widget code. The generated widget includes all the functionality users expect: clicking reactions, viewing stats, and proper persistence.

Does the tab system work correctly now? And does the generated widget code include everything you need for the popup functionality?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
